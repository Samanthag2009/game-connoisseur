# Game Connoisuer

Created by nerds like you, Game Connoisuer is an app designed to function as your personal game data library. Add games you've played, are playing, or would like to play and add your own comments and rating to them. Browse games that others are playing and connect with others around the world.

## Description

Game Connoisuer is an app made to act as a game library with the following features:

* Login/Logout: an authentication-based sign in process to secure your password and allow you access to your profile. When you're done, simply log out.

* Profile: Your profile is your home base where you can access "My Games" and see your list of games you'd like to play in the future, games you're currently playing, or games you've played before. All your games have the ability to be commented on and given a review rating from 1-5.
(SS)

* All Games: the All Games page is a page to show you what everyone else is talking about; see games that other users are uploading and maybe even find your new favorite!
